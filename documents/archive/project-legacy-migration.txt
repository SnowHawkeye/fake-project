Project: Legacy CRM Migration (ARCHIVED)
Completed: October 2024

Summary:
Successfully migrated from the in-house CRM (built 2016) to Salesforce.
~15,000 customer records were migrated with full data validation.

Outcomes:
- Zero data loss confirmed post-migration
- Sales team adoption reached 90% within 30 days
- Reduced manual reporting time by ~8 hours/week across the sales org

Lessons learned:
- Data cleansing took 3x longer than estimated; invest more time in discovery upfront.
- Stakeholder communication plan was critical — weekly update emails kept leadership informed and reduced escalations.
- Custom Salesforce objects required more configuration than anticipated; allow buffer time for this.

Archived assets:
- Migration runbook: stored in Confluence (legacy projects space)
- Data mapping spreadsheet: Google Drive (shared drive "2024 Projects")
- Test results: Jira epic PROJ-1102
