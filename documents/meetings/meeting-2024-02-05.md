## Sprint Review

### Completed

- Data ingestion module for Project Alpha (first version)
- Project Beta scope document (draft)

## Retrospective

### What went well

- Daily standups kept the team aligned
- Backend work on Project Alpha moved faster than estimated
- Cross-team collaboration on the portal downtime investigation

### What could be improved

- Dependency on UX contractor caused delays; need to build buffer time into timelines
- Sprint planning should account for on-call rotation impact
