Sprint Retrospective - January Sprint (Jan 6 – Jan 17, 2025)

Facilitator: Jordan Kim
Attendees: Sarah, Alex, Jordan, Marcus, Priya, James

--- What went well ---
- Strong collaboration between frontend and backend teams on Project Alpha API work.
- CI pipeline improvements reduced build times by ~25%.
- All sprint commitments were met despite two team members being on PTO.

--- What could be improved ---
- Sprint planning sessions ran over time; consider timebox of 90 minutes max.
- Some tickets lacked clear acceptance criteria, leading to rework.
- Communication between Project Alpha and Project Beta teams was ad-hoc; schedule a regular sync.

--- Action items ---
- Sarah: Add acceptance criteria template to Jira ticket workflow by Jan 24.
- Marcus: Document CI setup and share with the broader engineering org.
- James: Set up bi-weekly cross-project sync starting Feb 3.

--- Team health ---
Overall morale: Good. Energy is high going into Q1.
One concern raised: on-call rotation coverage is thin; will address in next sprint planning.
