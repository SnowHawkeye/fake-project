Project Beta Kick-off Meeting - February 3, 2025

Attendees: James Okafor (lead), Priya Sharma, Leo Tran, Dana Wu, + stakeholders from Finance and Sales

Agenda:
1. Project overview and goals
2. Roles and responsibilities
3. Timeline review
4. Q&A

Summary:
James walked through the project brief. The main driver is the CEO's request for a live revenue
dashboard ahead of the board meeting in Q2. Finance and Sales reps confirmed their top-priority
metrics: ARR, churn rate, pipeline coverage, and regional breakdown.

Key decisions made:
- Use Looker as the BI layer (approved by IT)
- Priya will own the data modeling workstream
- Leo will handle ETL pipeline development
- Dana is the liaison to Project Gamma for warehouse readiness

Open questions:
- Which historical date range is needed for trend analysis? (Finance to confirm by Feb 10)
- Will external partner data be in scope for v1? (Deprioritized for now, revisit in v2 planning)

Next meeting: February 17 — sprint planning for Phase 1
