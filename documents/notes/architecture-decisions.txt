Architecture Decision Notes
Last updated: February 5, 2025

--- ADR-001: Choose API Gateway ---
Decision: Use AWS API Gateway (HTTP API, not REST API)
Rationale: Lower cost, lower latency; REST API features (usage plans, caching) not needed for our use case.
Status: Accepted

--- ADR-002: Authentication Strategy ---
Decision: Implement OAuth 2.0 with Cognito as the identity provider
Rationale: Avoids building and maintaining custom auth; Cognito supports SSO with corporate SAML IdP.
Status: Accepted
Trade-offs: Adds Cognito as an infrastructure dependency; team needs to ramp up on Cognito specifics.

--- ADR-003: Frontend State Management ---
Decision: Use React Query for server state; avoid Redux
Rationale: Most state in this app is server state (fetched data). React Query handles caching, refetching, and
loading states cleanly. Redux adds overhead with little benefit here.
Status: Accepted

--- ADR-004: Database ---
Decision: PostgreSQL on RDS (Aurora Serverless v2)
Rationale: Aurora Serverless v2 scales to zero, reducing costs in non-prod environments.
Status: Proposed – pending cost estimate review by Feb 14.

Notes: Revisit database choice if write throughput requirements increase significantly beyond current projections.
