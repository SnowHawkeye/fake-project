Brainstorm - Internal Developer Experience Improvements
Date: January 28, 2025
Author: Marcus Lee

Ideas collected during informal eng team session:

1. Unified local dev environment
   - Consolidate setup into a single `make dev` command
   - Use Docker Compose to spin up all services consistently
   - Add health checks and auto-seed scripts for local DB

2. Improve onboarding docs
   - Current README is outdated (last updated 2023)
   - Create a "Getting Started in 30 minutes" guide
   - Record a short walkthrough video

3. Reduce alert fatigue
   - Too many non-actionable PagerDuty alerts
   - Audit all alerts and classify as P1/P2/P3
   - Silence or downgrade anything that hasn't required action in 60 days

4. Internal tooling wishlist
   - Slack bot to look up ticket status without leaving Slack
   - Deploy dashboard showing what's live in each environment
   - Automated changelog generation from commit messages
